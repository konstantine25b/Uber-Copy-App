# Uber-Copy-App
This project aimed to provide users with a convenient and efficient transportation solution by leveraging Google's APIs, including Maps and Directions.

Using React Native, I designed and built a mobile application that closely resembled the user interface and functionality of the Uber app. Users were able to search for locations, select their desired type of taxi, and request a ride.

To ensure accurate and efficient route calculations, I integrated Google Maps and Directions APIs. This allowed users to find the fastest and most optimal routes between their pickup and drop-off locations.

Additionally, I implemented features such as estimated time of arrival, and fare calculation. Users could conveniently monitor their ride's progress and obtain a fair estimate of the expected fare.

Throughout the development process, I focused on delivering a smooth and intuitive user experience. I optimized the app's performance, ensuring fast loading times and responsive interactions. I also paid attention to the app's design, incorporating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

By creating this Uber clone, I showcased my proficiency in React Native development and my ability to integrate third-party APIs effectively.
